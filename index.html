              A scuba diver is exploring a shallow coral reef underwater, observing a large shark swimming nearby. The diver, wearing a black wetsuit and fins, is seen swimming slowly and cautiously through the water, maintaining a safe distance from the shark. The scene is set in a clear, blue underwater environment with sunlight filtering through the water, illuminating the sandy seabed and the surrounding marine life. The shark moves gracefully through the water, its body undulating smoothly as it swims. The diver's movements are deliberate and slow, ensuring they do not disturb the shark. The background remains relatively static, with only minor movements from the smaller fish in the water. The overall movement is slow and steady, with the shark's direction being primarily horizontal across the frame. The main subjects are the scuba diver and the shark. The diver is positioned on the right side of the frame, wearing a black wetsuit and fins, and is seen swimming slowly and cautiously. The shark is on the left side of the frame, swimming in the same direction as the diver but at a greater distance. The shark's body is streamlined, and it moves smoothly through the water. The background consists of a sandy seabed covered with patches of green seaweed and smaller fish. The water is clear, allowing sunlight to penetrate and create a serene underwater atmosphere. The scene is set in a shallow coral reef, with the sandy bottom and marine vegetation providing a natural habitat for the marine life. The camera is stationary, providing a wide-angle view of the scene. The perspective is from the diver's point of view, capturing both the diver and the shark in the frame.

      We propose a refined data processing pipeline to further improve the consistency between fine-grained conditions and video content, including transition detection methods, structured caption system, Video Training Suitability Score and metric conditions.

    <p>
      First, we propose a more accurate and efficient transition detection method for video splitting. 
      Then we caption splitted videos with an average length of 200 words based on our structured caption system. 
      Subsequently, we train a Video Training Suitability Score (VTSS) for data filtering to prevent high-quality data from the erroneous deletion. 
      Finally, we introduce multiple data sub-metrics as Metric Conditions into the generation model to enrich the fine-grained conditions.
